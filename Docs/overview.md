This document provides an architectural overview of the Web4-Main system, including core components and their interactions.

- Node.js server logic
- Nacos integration for dynamic service discovery
- Docker container setup
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions

# Project Overview

## 🧠 Architecture Philosophy

Web4-Main is built to support resilient, microservice-driven architectures with full lifecycle automation. Its primary goals are:

- Seamless service discovery via Nacos
- Dynamic configuration updates across services
- Container-first deployment strategy using Docker and CI/CD pipelines
- Extensibility via custom Node.js modules


## 🏗️ Core Components

```
| Component      | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nacos          | Acts as both service registry and configuration server                      |
| Server.js      | Hosts custom backend logic and service integrations                         |
| Docker         | Containerizes each service for consistent runtime across environments       |
| GitHub Actions | Automates build, test, and deployment workflows                             |
| bash.sh        | Shell script to initiate builds and manage service startup                  |

## 🎯 Key Goals

- Maintain high availability across services
- Enable configuration changes without redeployment
- Simplify orchestration for distributed environments

Web4-Main empowers backend teams to focus on service logic while infrastructure, discovery, and updates are automated behind the scenes.
