# Service Architecture

This document explains how services interact with the Nacos backend:

- How services register
- How configuration updates are pushed
- Health check handling and re-registration logic

# 🔗 Service Architecture

This document explains how individual services within Web4 interact with the Nacos backend for dynamic configuration and service discovery.

## 🧭 Service Registration

- Upon startup, each service sends a registration payload to the Nacos server via its REST API.
- Registration includes service name, IP address, port, and metadata (e.g. health check interval).
- Nacos uses this data to populate the service registry for runtime discovery.

## 🔧 Configuration Updates

- Services subscribe to their config namespace within Nacos.
- Any config change triggers a push to active subscribers (via long polling or WebSocket, depending on setup).
- Updates may include database credentials, feature flags, or environment variables.

## 💓 Health Checks & Re-registration

- Each service exposes a `/health` endpoint monitored by Nacos.
- On failure detection, Nacos removes the service from the registry until it recovers.
- Services are responsible for re-registering after restart or transient failure.

If you’re up for it, we could also add example JSON payloads or flow diagrams showing the service–Nacos interaction sequence. Want me to sketch that out next?📐

# 🔗 Service Architecture

This document explains how individual services within Web4 interact with the Nacos backend for dynamic configuration and service discovery.

## 🧭 1. Service Registration

- Services send a registration request to the Nacos API during startup.
- Payload includes:
  ```json
  {
    "serviceName": "web4-api",
    "ip": "172.18.0.2",
    "port": 8080,
    "metadata": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "healthCheck": "/health"
    }
  }
